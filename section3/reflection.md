## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One point that resonated with me was that mistakes are critical to learning. I have heard this before but I never thought of it while I am learning to code.
Something brand new to me was using SMART goals for individual coding projects. I think that is a very helpful practice.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I do currently demonstrate a growth mindset in that i truly believe my coding will get much better and that I will be able to do it on the professional level. As much of a struggle as it is sometimes, I know I really am learning so much.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is a complete unit to store all kinds of data. It differs from an array in that a hash has key value pairs, where an array is an itemized list.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```ruby
pet_store = {
  dog_jerky: 5,
  bones: 20,
  cat_cans: 45,
  ropes: 12
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```ruby
puts states['IA']
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```ruby
puts states.keys
puts states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Another example of using a hash is on a social media platform such as YouTube. Then it can be multiple hashes for each video that a certain channel has published.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I am very curious to understand what more complicated hashes look like for instance with a facebook pages posting. I just want to see the real world use of hashes for a company.
