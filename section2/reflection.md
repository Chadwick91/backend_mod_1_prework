## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

After completing the Mod0 sessions, I have seen people who ask questions right away, people who wait awhile and people who never ask. For myself, I am certainly one who likes to figure it out on my own before asking. I will admit I have found some answers by following a thread on slack of a question another student asked. As I continue, I know I will put a large effort into finding the solution on my own, but I will work on not hesitating to ask when I just can't figure it out.
