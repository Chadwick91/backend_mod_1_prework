## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already teach others what I know, if i just learned it, it helps to explain to someone what i learned and how it works.
What I want to incorporate into my habits is taking short breaks often to help retain the information.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
``` ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

The octothorpe symbol: `#` 

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is a whole number, a float is a number with a decimal point.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

``` ruby
animal = "zebra"
'''

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
``` ruby
puts animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is the insertion of variables into string such as this:
``` ruby
puts "In Africa, the #{animal} is a common sight."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
The method used is `gets.chomp`.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
`.split` is a method that takes a string and splits each word into an array. 
`.length` is a method that tells you the length of a string including spaces.
